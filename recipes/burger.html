        <h2><em>Description</em></h2>

        <p>A burger is a sandwich made with a patty of cooked ground 
            meat between two halves of a bun. Burgers are an American 
            fast food that are traditionally made with ground beef. 
            They are often served with toppings like lettuce, tomato, 
            onion, pickles, ketchup, mustard, bacon, avocado, mushrooms, 
            cheese sauce, or chili.

        <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>

            <ul>
                <li>sesame Bun</li>
                <li>ground beef</li>
                <li>Tomato</li>
                <li>American Cheese</li>
                <li>Condiments</li>
            </ul>

        <h3><em>Steps</em></h3>


            <ol>
                <li>Form the beef into a ball, 
                    then smash it into a disc</li>
                <li>Use your thumb to make a small indentation 
                    in the center of each patty. This helps the burger 
                    cook evenly and prevents it from puffing up while 
                    cooking.</li>
                <li>Put the buns face down in a skillet for a few seconds 
                    to toast the inside so they don't get soggy when they 
                    touch the patty's fat.</li>
                <li>Grill the burgers at about 300Â°F. Grilling gives the burgers 
                    a delicious crust and a better texture than pressing them.</li>
                <li>Grill the burgers on very high heat so the fat caramelizes and 
                    forms a crispy exterior while the burger sears.</li>

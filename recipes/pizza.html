        <h2><em>Description</em></h2>

        <p><em>Pizza</em> is an Italian dish that consists of a flat, 
            round, leavened dough base, a layer of sauce, and one or 
            more toppings. Toppings can include meat, seafood, vegetables, 
            fruit, cheese, olives, oregano, tomatoes, spices, and herbs. 
            Pizza is often baked in a wood-fired oven at a high temperature.

        <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>

        <h3><em>Steps</em></h3>

        <ol>

            <li>Preheat over to 450 F</li>
            <li>Divide the dough in half.</li>
            <li>Roll out the dough into a thin, round shape.</li>
            <li>Brush the dough with olive oil.</li>
            <li>Prepare the toppings. This can include chopped 
                vegetables, charred meat, shredded cheese, and sauce.</li>
            <li>Top the pizza with cheese, then toppings, and finally 
                garnishes like basil or pepper.</li>
            <li>Bake the pizza for 15â€“20 minutes, or until the cheese is 
                bubbly and the crust is golden brown. If you're using a 
                pizza stone, you can bake the pizza without letting 
                the dough rise first.</li>
            <li>Transfer the pizza to a cardboard disc, cookie sheet, or cutting board.</li>
